  tree: [
    ['New leaves', 'A Japanese maple, Acer palmatum, about 4 m tall. Its buds open in late March and leaves grow in pairs along each twig. A new leaf is pale yellow-green: it is still making chlorophyll, the pigment that absorbs light for making sugar.'],
    ['Full leaf', 'The leaves are held out flat in layers, so few are shaded by the ones above.'],
    ['The outside turns first', 'Leaves in full sun turn first and turn reddest, because a leaf needs light to make the red pigment. Shaded leaves inside the crown turn yellow or orange.'],
    ['Every leaf has turned', 'Red on the outside of the crown, orange and yellow within. The first leaves are falling.'],
    ['Bare twigs', 'A leaf falls once the layer of cells that held its stalk to the twig has come apart. The leaf we follow, ringed in white, is the last to go.'],
  ],
  leaf: [
    ['One leaf unfolds', 'The leaf has seven pointed lobes, each with a vein down its middle. The veins bring water in and carry sugar out.'],
    ['Green', 'Chlorophyll absorbs light near 440 nm and near 675 nm. Light around 550 nm is absorbed least, so more of it comes back or passes through than at other wavelengths, and we see the leaf as green.'],
    ['Chlorophyll is taken apart', 'The leaf dismantles the proteins that hold its chlorophyll and sends their nitrogen back into the tree. The chlorophyll is broken down. Green lasts longest beside the veins.'],
    ['Red', 'The leaf makes a new pigment, an anthocyanin, from sugar that builds up in it. Anthocyanin absorbs light from about 480 to 580 nm. What comes back is mostly longer than 600 nm, which we see as red.'],
    ['The stalk lets go', 'Across the foot of the stalk, a layer of cells dissolves the walls that join them, while cork seals the twig behind. Then the leaf\'s weight breaks it off.'],
  ],
  tissue: [
    ['Inside the leaf', 'A window is cut through the leaf (0.8 mm wide once the leaf is grown), and this is one wall of it. Full grown, the leaf is 0.14 mm thick. Under a clear skin one cell thick stand tall cells, side by side. Below them are loose cells with air between, then the lower skin.'],
    ['Where the light is used', 'Most light is absorbed in the tall cells, which hold the most chloroplasts: the green bodies. Carbon dioxide comes in through pores in the lower skin and spreads through the air spaces. The bundle of pipes on the right is a vein.'],
    ['Green lasts by the vein', 'Cells far from a vein lose their chlorophyll first. Those beside it keep theirs a few days longer.'],
    ['Red on the sunlit side', 'Anthocyanin is made mostly in the tall cells under the upper skin, where the light is strongest. The loose cells below make little. That is why a maple leaf is redder on top than underneath.'],
    ['Emptied', 'Sugar, and the nitrogen from dismantled proteins, left through the vein before the stalk was sealed. Cell walls, carotenoids and anthocyanin stay behind.'],
  ],
  cells: [
    ['One cell', 'One of the tall cells; full grown it is 11 µm wide and 41 µm tall. The bodies along its wall are chloroplasts, where the chlorophyll is. The clear column down its middle is the vacuole, a store of water.'],
    ['Chloroplasts', 'Each chloroplast is about 5 µm long and lies against the cell wall, next to the air spaces that bring carbon dioxide. Inside its clear envelope are stacks of membrane, like stacks of coins. The chlorophyll is in those membranes.'],
    ['Chloroplasts fade', 'The stacks of membrane are taken apart and their chlorophyll is broken down. The chloroplasts shrink and turn yellow: carotenoids are what is left in them.'],
    ['Crimson vacuoles', 'Anthocyanin dissolves in water, so it collects in the vacuole and not in the chloroplasts. Seen from outside, the leaf\'s red is the yellow of its chloroplasts and the crimson of its vacuoles together.'],
    ['The last days', 'The cells have sent about half or more of their nitrogen and phosphorus back into the tree. They die soon after the leaf falls.'],
  ],
  membrane: [
    ['Chlorophyll', 'The face of one membrane in a stack. Each ring with a pale magnesium atom at its centre and a long tail is one chlorophyll molecule. The leaf is still making them.'],
    ['Why chlorophyll is green', 'Eighteen electrons are shared right round the ring instead of staying between two atoms. The more atoms electrons are spread over, the less energy it takes to lift them, so they take in light we can see instead of ultraviolet: here near 440 and 675 nm. Watch the dots of light: those two bands are swallowed, and what we see as green goes by.'],
    ['Chlorophyll is taken apart', 'One enzyme removes the magnesium, another cuts off the tail, a third opens the ring, and the pieces are soon made colourless: an opened ring no longer shares its electrons all the way round. The carotenoids, the long chains, stay.'],
    ['Why carotenoids are yellow', 'A carotenoid shares electrons along a chain of 11 double bonds. It takes in light from 400 to 500 nm, which we see as violet and blue. The rest goes by, and together that looks yellow.'],
    ['What is left', 'About half of the carotenoids are still here when the leaf falls. They are why a fallen maple leaf with little anthocyanin is yellow.'],
  ],
  vacuole: [
    ['Water', 'Inside the vacuole. In spring there is no pigment here: only water, with salts and sugars dissolved in it. The dots of light pass straight through.'],
    ['Water', 'Inside the vacuole. All summer there is no pigment here: only water, with salts and sugars dissolved in it. The dots of light pass straight through.'],
    ['Anthocyanin arrives', 'Each molecule is cyanidin 3-glucoside, the red pigment of maple leaves: three rings (the middle one includes an oxygen atom) joined to one sugar. It is made outside the vacuole and moved in.'],
    ['Why anthocyanin is red', 'Its three rings share one set of electrons, a shorter run than chlorophyll\'s ring, but its oxygen atoms and its positive charge shift what it takes in to longer wavelengths than a plain chain that short would: around 530 nm, which we see as green. What goes by is mostly longer than 600 nm, which we see as red.'],
    ['Still red', 'Anthocyanin is not taken back into the tree. It stays in the leaf when it falls.'],
  ],

The glowing bonds are the ones whose shared electrons take in visible light. The beads underneath are the heads of the membrane\'s fat molecules. In a real membrane the pigments sit inside it, held by proteins, which are not drawn; here they are lifted onto its face so that they can be seen. Chlorophyll comes in two kinds, a and b; a is drawn, and only one of its five oxygen atoms. In autumn the real membrane is taken apart too, and the carotenoids that remain end up in drops of fat. Each dot of light stands for a little light of one wavelength, drawn in the colour we see it as, and moving far slower than light does; a real wave of visible light is about a hundred times wider than this view. One molecule has no colour: each is drawn in the colour its pigment has in bulk.',
  vacuole: 'Sticks are bonds between atoms; carbon is drawn pale and oxygen dark red so that they show against the red water; hydrogen is left out. The water\'s own colour hides the rest of the cell, and molecules more than a hundred or so nanometres away; real cell sap is far clearer than that. The glowing bonds are the ones whose shared electrons take in visible light. Water is not drawn. The pigment is drawn a few times more crowded than it is in a deep red cell. Each dot of light stands for a little light of one wavelength, moving far slower than light does.',
